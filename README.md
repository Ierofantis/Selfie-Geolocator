#Selfie Geolocator

I've converted https://github.com/Ierofantis/Selfie_geoloc to mobile app. In order to run this app you should have android studio installed on your machine.

Download the app from here or git clone

Go to the directory after the download and press: npm install

Install cordova globally (if you haven't) and run cordova run android 

Then this app will play on your device or your emulator.

If you want to just test this app in your mobile then after the command cordova run android go to \platforms\android\build\outputs\apk and transfer this file to your mobile.
